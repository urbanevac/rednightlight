# üî¥ Red Light Flashlight

A web-based red light flashlight app designed to preserve night vision while providing illumination. Perfect for astronomy, night photography, military operations, or any situation where you need to see in the dark without ruining your night adaptation.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Red Light Mode**: Preserves night vision while providing illumination
- **Adjustable Brightness**: Fine-tune the light intensity with an intuitive slider
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Maximize your device's screen for maximum illumination

## üîç Why Red Light?

Red light preserves night vision because it doesn't trigger the same photoreceptors in your eyes that are responsible for night vision. This makes it ideal for:

- Astronomy observations
- Reading maps or documents in the dark
- Military operations
- Night photography
- Navigating at night without disrupting your night vision
